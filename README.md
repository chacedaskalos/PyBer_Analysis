# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the Analysis
###Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data by urban, suburban, and rural city types to find trends in rides, drivers, and fares. PyBer will benefit greatly with business decisions with this data. In order to aid visualizization of the data I created bubble charts, box and whisker plots, and pie charts. 

##Results
###Differences in city types
####Overall The "big picture" differences between city types is seen easily in this table. ![correct_overall_data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96211484/151737421-1f481f8e-c0c6-42a0-a1b8-f343bfe3c639.png)
To summarize, all the data points are what I'd expect going from urban-suburban-rural. 
####Urban Urban cities tend to be more populated than suburban and rural, therefore have a higher demand. There must be a high supply in order to fulfill that demand. There was exactly 13 times more rides in Urban vs. rural, and 30.8 times more drivers.

####Suburban Suburban data is the middle ground right inbetween urban and rural. The average fare per driver seems relatively fair compared to the supply and demand in rural and urban city types. Suburban rides accounted for 30.5% of the fares while only having 26.3% of the total rides as seen in these two pie charts![Fig5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96211484/151738261-0dfb0661-f4ed-44cf-bf65-c9593be0e46c.png)

####Rural As a result of having so few rides and so few drivers compared to urban and suburban, rural average fares are forced to be much higher. Specifically 1.4 times higher than suburban and a whopping 3.35 times higher than urban


##Summary
###3 Business reccomendations for PyBer
1. Promotion offers to the riders in the rural city type to try to find new riders. Expanding that customer base would increase the revenue for rural.

3. I would consider looking at increasing the fare for urban rides since 68.4% of the rides are urban. There can be some fine-tuning done based on suply and demand![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96211484/151736235-a2a6c537-f376-4f69-b2a6-be970ddb58e6.png)

4. Increase the number of drivers in the rural cities. The increase in drivers will reduce the cost for riders based on supply and demand.
