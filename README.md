# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the Analysis
###Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data by urban, suburban, and rural city types to find trends in rides, drivers, and fares. PyBer will benefit greatly with business decisions with this data. In order to aid visualizization of the data I created bubble charts, box and whisker plots, and pie charts. 

##Results
##Differences in city types

##Summary
###3 Business reccomendations for PyBer
1. Promotion offers to the riders in the rural city type to try to find new riders. Expanding that customer base would increase the revenue for rural.

3. I would consider looking at increasing the fare for urban rides since 68.4% of the rides are urban. There can be some fine-tuning done based on suply and demand![Fig6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96211484/151736235-a2a6c537-f376-4f69-b2a6-be970ddb58e6.png)

4. Increase the number of drivers in the rural cities. The increase in drivers will reduce the cost for riders based on supply and demand.
